# But there are so many prot denoms!

The outrageous **"THERE ARE 33000 PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS!!!"** comes from the
World Christian Encyclopedia and it doesn't claim that there are that many
protestant denominations, it claims that there are that many Christian
denominations in total. It actually claims there are 9000 protestant, 781
Orthodox, and 242 Catholics denominations based on its very specific and
nonsense definition.

If you're a catholic I'm sure you get very frustrated when statements made by
the Pope are presented without context, intentionally misconstrued, or simply
fabricated. If you're a orthodox I'm sure you get very frustrated when people
mischaracterize your tradition as hand waving, anti intellectual, without
answers, or papism without a pope.  As a protestant claims of tens of thousands
of denominations are similarly unfair. As a brother in christ I ask that you
please stop repeating this falsehood which embarrassed you and insults me.

If the standard that says there are hundreds of your denomination is obviously
incorrect then do not apply it to others. Equal weights and measures please.

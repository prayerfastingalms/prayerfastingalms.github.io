# Beginner's Guide to Prepping

This guide is designed for those who feel like they should prepare for
"something" but do not want to make a lifestyle of it. First we begin within
a summary of what kind of events you should be preparing for. Second is
a shopping list of items. Lastly, are some notes on other behaviors that you
can adopt that will help.

## What am I preparing for?

Your life will be punctuated with everyday disasters: flat tires, burst
plumbing, etc. This guide is not intended to address those events. This guide
is to address the tier above those disasters. These disasters include:

- floods
- cyclones/hurricanes/typhoons
- earthquakes
- wildfires/bushfires
- riots
- prolonged grid down situations / blackouts
- snow storms and blizzards
- mud slides and landslides
- volcanic eruptions 
- tsunamis
- terrorist attacks

Personally I live in an environment and nation affected by only one, maybe two,
of these events. While everything depends on your own personal circumstances
you can expect that there will be four major disruptions that need to be
overcome:

- No power
- No running water
- No resupply of food or medication
- No emergency services

These are the four horseman that we need to contend with.

Current advice from the "experts" states that the average person should prepare
supplies for 2 weeks at home and 3 days on the road. Experience implies that we
should round up to 4 weeks and 4 days. Assume no one is coming for 4 weeks, no
power, no food, no water, and “something” has happened that also needs to be
triaged. Will you starve? Will you have enough clean water to drink? Where will
you shit? Can you triage the disaster for yourself, family, and neighbours?

You need to do your own research and discover the risks for your local area and
you need to prepare accordingly.

## What do I buy?

The list is roughly ordered in terms of importance. The recomended order to buy
is section-by-section. Don't do it all at once, but set aside a little money
and chip away at the list. The only exception would be the "Don't die" section,
you should probably buy 2 weeks worth of supplies for that section very soon.

**You will need to duplicate this for everyone in your household**

### Don't die

**I do not know what is required to survive in cold (e.g. snowing) environment.
Consult a relevant "expert"** 

The human needs air, water, heat, and food or it will die. Your
first priority is ensuring that you have what you need to live. A short list of
equipment includes:

- Medication: Assume that the pharmacy isn't restocked, what do you need? Are
  you a diabetic? Heart medication?
- Bottled water: Major rain, earthquakes, and even economic instability can
  prevent clean water from flowing from the taps. An earthquake can cause
  disruptions for weeks, and major rain events can taint the water. You should
  either have a way of purifying dirty water or storing enough water for
  4 weeks. Assume 1 gallon (approximately 3 to 4 litres) per day.
- Food: Store 1500 calories per person per day. Remember that canned goods
  expire and need to be cycled. You will need a food supply that you can:
  - maintain (i.e. doesn't expire too quickly)
  - will eat
  - doesn't require lots of heat or water (e.g. not rice, maybe lentils,
    probably canned goods)
- Fully stocked first aid kit: Start with a premade one, add the bits and
  pieces that you might need in addition to that. Medication worth including
  extras of:
  - Acetaminophen
  - Ibuprofen
  - Antihistamines
  - Cold and flu medication
  - Anti-diarrhea medication
  - Feminine Hygiene products
- Spare food for your animals
- Blankets, clothes, fuel, house: You need to ensure that without electricity
  and resupply that the heat and cold don't kill you. You needs will vary
  depending on location.
- Fire extinguishers
- Baby Supplies: Diapers/formula. ointments/aspirin, etc.

### Essentials

Additionally, the following are essential:

- A way of dealing with your shit and piss and cleaning yourself afterwards.
  This may be as simple as shitting off a bridge and a baby wipe. This might be
  a deep hole. You need a plan.
- Dynamo or battery powered radio: This may be your only access to emergency
  communications.
- Decent headlamp with spare batteries: you will want to be able to see at
  night and this ensures that your hands remain free. 
- Cash: Many problems can be solved within money. Store several hundred
  dollars.
- PPE: You need to prevent yourself from becoming injured while helping others:
  - gloves
  - respirator
  - tough boots and clothes
  - goggles
  - helmet
- Decent tools to triage a disaster: Anything you might need to deal with
  rubble, mud, collapsed structures, fires, car crashes, etc:
  - nail hammer
  - sledge hammer
  - mallet
  - demo/pry bar
  - hatchet
  - bolt cutters
  - cordless angle grinder or hacksaw
  - shovel
  - pick
  - hoe/mattock (for digging drainage trenches)
  - chainsaw (or regular saw)
  - hatchet
  - lots of rope
  - winch (on car or by hand)
  - pliers
  - wrenches
  - folding knife
  - Spare blades and bits for everything



### Longer term must haves

For longer disasters you will want to include:

- Self defence equipment: Depending on your environment looting and violence is
  extremely unlikely to occur as a result of a disaster. Unless you live in
  a rich cosmopolitan city (let the reader understand), at which point this
  becomes essential. In a guns allowed zone that will probably be a shotgun or
  a pistol. Otherwise its probably going to be a pitchfork(spear), machete
  (sword), folding knife, hatchet, hammer, or pointed stick (spear).
- Spare fuel for your vehicle: Safely stored. Note that fuel does evaporate and
  normally can't be stored for more than a few months. Less if there is ethanol
  added.
- Drugs: You want to avoid withdrawals:
  - Caffeine pills
  - Nicotine gum
  - Vodka
- Salt, honey, and spices: Salt is especially important. Honey and salt can be
  stored forever
- Cooking suppliers:
  - Paper plates and plastic cutlery: You don't want to be doing dishes. Buy
    a stack and just throw it all in the trash.
  - Cooking oil
  - Dishwashing supplies
  - Stock cubes
- Socks: Good thick wool socks that don't cause blisters
- Garbage bags: great for storage, garbage, waterproofing things, closing over
  broken windows, blocking out light, rain collection, managing biohazards, etc
- Duct tape. Much duct tape.
- Fire starting equipment:
  - A dozen cheap bic lighters
  - A ferro rod
- Spare medical and mobility equipment: glasses, walkers, braces, puffers, etc

### Nice to haves

Equipment that is good to have but non essential includes:

- Baby wipes: This may be the only way to take a shower for weeks. Its also an
  old soldiers trick. Very very important for women.
- Chalk: box of chalk for marking structures (very situational)
- Big Esky: food storage, water storage, separate out high use items from your
  fridge to keep the fridge colder for longer
- Many disposable gloves: great for first aid, biohazards, extra insulation
  against cold
- Rain gear: Contextual. You may also want tarps and cordage. May be extremely
  important
- Pest control:
  - Mice and rat traps and poison
  - Roach, ant, and insect poison
  - Mosquito coils and bug sprays
- Entertainment: books, cards, something to keep you and others sane
- Multivitamins: A month is long enough for the deficiencies of rice and beans
  to set in.
- Books:
  - What to do when there is no doctor
- Fuel for fires
- Water Filters/Purifiers


### On the road

Under construction...

## What else should I do?

- You should try and build enough slack into your way of like that a two week
“you can not leave your dwelling” is as simple as living off your supplies.
-  If you can, grow food, have chooks, and learn how to repair the things you own.
  Also, rather than stockpiling booze, bullets, and bullion you should try to
  accumulate skills that you can use to barter with. Basic carpentry, welding,
  autorepair, and roofing are all good choices
- You will also want to develop the pattern of taking notes. A battery powered
  camera is great for taking notes (accurately and quickly capture a scene,
  label, and copy handwritten notes)
- Honestly most people aren't ready for a blackout that goes for more than a day.
  Electric stoves, microwaves, fridges, freezer, and often an electric hot water
  system - what do you eat?
- Memorise phone numbers
- Have copies of important documents
- Most people spend more than a third of their lives at work. Plan accordingly.
